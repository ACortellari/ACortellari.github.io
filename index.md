<p>Primary and secondary sources on the history of Turkey's Left and Palestine</p>

<p>This ongoing project is one of the results of research undertaken in 2018 and 2019 in Leiden, Amsterdam, and Istanbul. It is a scrappy attempt to make a number of sources more widely available and the outcome of thinking for a long time about what to do with a corpus of sources collected while researching my MA thesis in Middle Eastern Studies. I worked on my thesis, <a href="https://studenttheses.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/82728">Bringing Palestine Home: A Transnational History of Turkey’s Radical Left and Palestine (1967-1972)</a>, under the supervision of Dr. Alp A. Yenen, and submitted it in 2019 as part of my MA at Leiden University.</p> 

<p>The goal of this project is to make a number of primary sources more readily available to those who are interested in studying the history of the radical left in Turkey and its linkages and intellectual connections with the Palestinian organizations during the Cold War.</p>
