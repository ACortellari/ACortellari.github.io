<p>Primary and secondary sources on the history of Turkey's Left and Palestine</p>

<p>This ongoing project is one of the results of research undertaken in 2018 and 2019 in Leiden, Amsterdam, and Istanbul. It is a scrappy attempt to make a number of sources more widely available and the outcome of thinking for a long time about what to do with a corpus of sources collected while researching my MA thesis in Middle Eastern Studies, which I submitted in 2019 at Leiden University.</p> 

<p>The goal of this project is to make a number of primary sources more readily available to those who are interested in studying the history of the radical left in Turkey and its linkages and intellectual connections with the Palestinian organizations during the Cold War.</p>
